## Project to build

Create an application using NodeJS or Ruby (depending on the job offer you've applied) that scrapes and displays Twitter profiles using [ProxyCrawl Crawling API](https://proxycrawl.com/dashboard/docs).

*Please create a free account if you haven't done so yet, the first 1000 requests are free of charge, if you need more free requests please ask the person in charge of your role application.*

The application must have an interface to submit a twitter profile url and a ProxyCrawl API token, after submission, it should display as much information as you want to display from that profile page. The information must be crawled using the [ProxyCrawl Crawling API](https://proxycrawl.com/dashboard/docs).

All crawled profile information must be stored in the project as json files, one file per profile.
